        <p>
          <br />Emotional intelligence is the process of observing and
          identifying your own emotions and those of the people around you.
          <br />Although emotional intelligence is not merely knowing what
          emotions are, it is the act of remaining in control of one's emotional
          response in situations; especially those that are out of a person's
          control.
          <br />

        <h2>How is EQ different to IQ?</h2>
        <p>
          EQ and Iq are vastly different in that IQ is a measurable test for
          logical reasoning and problem solving “intelligence” whereas EQ refers
          to a person's understanding of their own emotions and those of others,
          while being able to manage emotional responses. More broadly, EQ is
          the building block to form strong bonds and relationships with others.
          <br />
        </p>
        <h2>Why is EQ important?</h2>
        <p>
          Emotions are often seen as big technicolour outbursts of responses
          people have to situations that often feel out of our reach to control.
          By practicing and training the brain to improve emotional intelligence
          (practice mindfulness, journaling) we can better understand our
          triggers, responses and those of others, ultimately leading to a more
          happier and calmer life.
