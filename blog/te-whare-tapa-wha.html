      <h2>Taha Tinana (physical Wellbeing)
      </h2>
      <br>
      I commit to exercise 3 times a week. This comes in the form of walking, running and the occasional youtube excerise video.
      <h2>Taha Whānau (Family Wellbeing)
      </h2>
      <br>
      This is one aspect of life I feel I already have under control. Our four kids are our priority and we organise many adventures and family time with each other.
      <h2>Taha Hinengaro (Emotional and Mental Wellbeing)
      </h2>
      <br>
      My journey with daily mindfulness practices and journaling are an immense help in this area. Also physical activity and reducing sugar intake are a massive impact on my mental health so I work on this everyday my making healthy choices.
      <br>
      <h2>Taha Wairua (Spiritual Wellbeing)</h2>
      <br>
      This area of my life has always been a bit of a question mark. I have always been a spiritual person in regards to seeing nature and the universe as my guide through life, but I feel a calling to add more ritual to my practices and I think tying that in to mindfulness meditations everyday will really enrich my spirituality.
      <br>
      <br>
      <h2>Whenua (Interconnections to the land and environment)
      </h2>
      <br>
      This of course ties in beautifully to Taha Wairua, my spirituality IS whenua. I practice grounding and being in nature whenever possible.
