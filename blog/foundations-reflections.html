        <h2>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the Human Skills learning?
        </h2>
        <p>
          Three things I have learnt about myself during the Human Skills learning are:<br>
          1. I am very determined to try things. I visualise success and take steps to practice the skills to improve the areas I am still struggling with and I’m really proud of that.<br>
          2. I am a very humble person. I should celebrate my wins more but I am usually fixed to carry on to the next hard thing and then feel like a failure. It is quite a loop I get myself in and I am painfully aware of it. I need to take time to celebrate the little wins, let them sink in and master them before I move on to the next challenge.<br>
          3. I always thought "I don't know much about coding" but I surprised myself that I actually do. 
          <br />

        <h2>What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?
        </h2>
        <p>
          Ultimately, I think the role of learning values, empathy and self-awareness is about having respect for the human condition and being aware of your own and what you bring to the table. At the end of the day programming is created in a team environment and you need to be able to work with a variety of people from various backgrounds to accomplish tasks together. Respect for difference is a must.

        <h2>What has surprised you the most about the Human Skills learning?
        </h2>
        <p>
          One thing that surprised me is the progress that was already happening within me and my growth mindset, without even realising it until now. I’m not here to say that I always keep my ego in check, more so that I am exceptionally aware of my ego and how it can sabotage my growth in this learning experience. I am surprised at the peaceful awareness I have of myself and my mind compared to how I conducted myself in my early 20’s.

        <h2>What were the most challenging aspects of the Human Skills learning?
        </h2>
        <p>
          Probably answering these questions! When you are forced to sit and type out your thoughts onto a screen for someone else to read, it is a bit daunting. I’m quite an open person and very much into my philosophy - I’m unsure how far deep into the human condition you would like me to dive!

        <h2>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on Human Skills learning in a web development Bootcamp course?
        </h2>
        <p>
          My answer is the same as above, in regards to the importance of learning values, empathy and self-awareness. Respect for others and to learn how to communicate well in a group..
          Programmers work in a team at the end of the day and not only do human skills help in that area, it helps being open to address issues you might have within yourself to grow. As people, we project our values and in the same instance, trauma, onto others, most of the time unknowingly. It is important to hold a mirror to our own reflection to see ourselves and all the areas we need to grow.

        <h2>Does the time you spent studying Human Skills learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.
        </h2>
        <p>
          Absolutely NOT a waste of time. Programming is great but it's all very logical and I’m confident that I might not do well now, but I will later down the track with repetition and constant exposure to programming. Human skills will be needed to collaborate with a team better and ultimately they are needed to conduct yourself well during interviews to be hired.
