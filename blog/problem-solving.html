        <h2>1. Tell your non-tech friend a story about a time you:</h2>
        <h2>
          what was the problem?<br />
          what problem-solving techniques did you use?<br />
          how did you feel throughout the process?<br />
          what did you learn?
        </h2>
        <p>
          I was working on the javascript kata challenge and got stuck with the
          super flip flop and gradebook challenges. I got stuck because I
          overcomplicated the logic and used the wrong method. I tried the
          rubber ducky method by talking through the problem step-by-step and
          used AI as a tutor to talk me through the problem. I also took a short
          break to clear my mind before trying again. At first, I felt
          frustrated and overwhelmed. I learned that taking a break and talking
          through the problem helps me see things more clearly and avoid
          overthinking.

          what was the problem?<br />
          what problem-solving techniques did you use?<br />
          how did you feel throughout the process? what did you learn?<br />

        <p>
          I was trying to write a sum() function in JavaScript. At first, it
          seemed tricky, but I broke it down into small steps. I stayed calm and
          avoided overcomplicating it. The solution worked on the first try, and
          I felt really proud of myself. I used the "trying something" method
          and made small adjustments until it worked. I learned that keeping it
          simple and focusing on one step at a time makes problems easier to
          solve. It also showed me that I understand more than I think I do!

        <h2>
          3. Reflect on how confident you feel using each of these
          problem-solving techniques/processes:
        </h2>
        <p>
          <em>Pseudocode :</em> I find this useful for planning out code but
          unfortunately I’m not so good with the plan yet to utilise it best!
          Trying something : I feel like this is my best problem solving skill.
          I first try something to see if it works and repeat until I have run
          out of ideas. <br />
          <br /><em>Rubber ducky method :</em> I like this one, I talk out loud
          accidentally most of the time so this actually comes naturally to
          me.<br />
          <br /><em>Reading error messages :</em> this is useful sometimes,
          especially to locate where the error is but it is still complicated to
          understand the error message at times.<br />
          <br /><em> Console.logging :</em> I feel I could utilise this better
          as a problem solving method, I do it to give me answers and I know the
          code has worked when the answer is right… that’s about it.<br />
          <br /><em>Googling :</em> I’m a very strong googler…<br />
          <br /><em>Asking your peers for help :</em> I haven't yet specifically
          asked my peers for help but I enjoy discussing the problems we are
          facing together in our loop sessions.<br />
          <br /><em>Asking coaches for help :</em> At first, I was a but
          embarrassed to post on discord but that has quickly gone. I’m here to
          learn and I want to utilise my coaches as much as possible.<br />
          <br /><em>Improving your process with reflection : </em> I’m still
          working on this. I enjoy reflecting what I have learnt back to my
          husband and try to explain it really simply.<br />
        </p>
        <h2>
          4. Reflect on a time you were reluctant to ask for help. Consider what
          made you reluctant to do so. What might you try differently next time?
        </h2>
        <p>
          I was reluctant to ask for help at the beginning of the course. I was
          embarrassed at times to post on the discord forums but I am now quite
          comfortable with it. I find it great when someone else posts in the
          discord forum about a problem, because it ends up helping me learn. So
          that is how I like to see my questions, they could also be helping
          someone else.
