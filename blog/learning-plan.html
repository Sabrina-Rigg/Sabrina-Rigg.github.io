        <p><h2>Bootcamp<br>
          What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h2>
          I think my short term goal is to get a placement as a junior developer for a company that wants to grow successful developers. I would like to work for people with strong moral ethics for their employees and I would like to learn from great programmers to better my skills and work on some really great projects.<br>
          My long term goal is to become a senior developer and be employed remotely so I can live my days in Wanaka ogling at mountains with my family - a girl can dream.
          <h2>What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</h2>
          My biggest strength will be the human skills I think, because of my background with my psychology degree and being a business owner/manager with a team to look after, I feel confident and passionate about working well in a team.<br>
          My limitation is not a limitation, really, it’s only my novice status with learning javascript and understanding computers. I’m only going to grow from here so I am looking forward to becoming more confident with programming skills.
          
          <h2>What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</h2>
          My biggest challenge will be to juggle my kids and organise a quiet space to work with my team, undisturbed. I also don’t want to let my team down if my skills are lesser than others, which is why I am going to practice!
          What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
          I would like to see myself grow in confidence when speaking in a group. I am confident if it is about a topic I am well versed in but if I am a novice, I take a backseat. I would like to challenge myself to be a bit more outspoken.
          <h2>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</h2>
          I expect dev academy to be understanding that I have four children and that that is a lot of children… haha no, sorry, I’ll be more specific.<br>
          I chose dev academy because I want to study part time, alongside raising my four children - I didn’t join dev academy to be a part time parent and a full time student so I expect an understanding from facilitators for me to find a balance that works for me as the stay at home parent for our family. And if I have that boundary respected, I will flourish.
          <h2>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</h2>
          My expectations for me during bootcamp is to clearly communicate if I cannot make a meeting and work my absolute hardest to support my team by keeping up with the learning material. I am determined to become a fullstack developer so I want to show up with 100% commitment and clear understanding of the material.

          <h2>Foundations<br>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h2>
          My long term goal is to have a stable and fun job in web development and software engineering that I can occasionally work remotely if needed. To begin with, my focus was finding employment that would be more flexible but I really do enjoy making something beautiful out of code! (or trying to)
          
          <h2>A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</h2>
          
          My strengths are my determination and love of seeing the end result. I also find learning coding skills fun so I look forward to the next lesson. My limitations are my time to learn, I am often trying to do it when my baby is napping or at night time - this too shall pass! Other limitations would be the overwhelm I can get (as mentioned before)
          
          <h2>What skills (non-technical/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h2>
          
          I’d like to see more confidence and outgoing behaviour in myself when it comes to job hunting and networking. I am an introverted - extrovert and I need an extra nudge to go out and get uncomfortable a lot of the time.
          <h2>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. <br>This should include:
          <br>- An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and industry/community representatives
          <br>- What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you</h2>
          
          My motto is “a little bit, everyday”. Whether that is just reading or practicing code, it’s the commitment I have made to myself to learn a new skill and manage my workload. This method also helps to keep the overwhelm away!
          I will manage myself to work productively because I am driven. I am also aware that I have four children and it gets busy, so my commitment is to communicate adequately if I can’t make a meeting etc.
          
          <h2>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h2>
          
          My commitment is to seek help after I have given it time to ‘sleep on it’. I do not want to waste anyone's time with simple questions google could help me with but I also don’t want to get behind with a block!
          
          <h2>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h2>
          I expect a helpful hand and explanations when I do get blocked, in a kind manner. It’s also great to have facilitators who have a foot on the ground in the world of where we want to be.
          
          <h2>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.</h2>
          
          I have very clear block-out time from 8 - 9.30am and 2 - 3.30pm for school pick up/drop off. Also the bedtimes 6.30-8, but I am aware the bootcamp times are around this time so I am organising help with relatives during the key bootcamp dates.

          <h1 class="main-heading">Learning Plan - REFLECTIONS</h1>
        <hr width="80%" size="2" color="black" />
        <p><h2>How accurate were your expectations of your learning needs and growth areas?<br></h2>
          My expectations were mostly accurate. I knew I would need strong time-management and that juggling study around my children would be my biggest constraint, and that has definitely proven true. I also expected to feel overwhelmed at times, especially when learning unfamiliar technical concepts, and that has also aligned with reality. What I didn’t fully appreciate was how quickly my technical confidence would grow once I stayed consistent. My prediction that “a little bit every day” would work has been spot-on — the steady routine has helped me progress without the intense burnout I feared.
          <h2>Were there any surprises / did you learn new things about yourself?<br></h2>
          Yes, a few. I learned that I’m more resilient than I often think, especially when tackling new or uncomfortable topics. I also realised I can contribute meaningfully to group spaces even when I’m not the most technically experienced person in the room. Another surprise was how much I enjoy the creative side of coding; it confirmed that this career path genuinely suits me. I also discovered that I don’t shut down under pressure as much as I used to. Instead, I ask better questions, take breaks, and return with more clarity.
          <h2>What challenges did you find in following your learning and wellbeing plan?<br></h2>
          The biggest challenge has been predictability. With four children, my environment isn’t always quiet or uninterrupted, even with planning. There were days where my “little bit every day” motto was hard to achieve, especially when family needs escalated. Another challenge was sticking to my goal of speaking up more in group situations — I still catch myself wanting to take a backseat when I’m unsure. Balancing self-imposed expectations with real-life limits has been an ongoing adjustment.
          <h2>What benefits did you experience from following your learning and wellbeing plan?<br></h2>
          My plan helped me maintain consistency without burning out. Doing smaller daily chunks kept the overwhelm away and allowed the content to settle more naturally. Clear communication expectations also made it easier to work with others, because I wasn’t silently stressing or falling behind. Organising block-out times helped me protect family routines without sacrificing progress. Overall, the wellbeing plan gave me structure, confidence, and a sense of control and that made the whole experience more enjoyable and sustainable.
