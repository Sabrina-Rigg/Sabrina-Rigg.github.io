        <p><h2>Bootcamp<br>
          What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h2>
          I think my short term goal is to get a placement as a junior developer for a company that wants to grow successful developers. I would like to work for people with strong moral ethics for their employees and I would like to learn from great programmers to better my skills and work on some really great projects.<br>
          My long term goal is to become a senior developer and be employed remotely so I can live my days in Wanaka ogling at mountains with my family - a girl can dream.
          <h2>What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</h2>
          My biggest strength will be the human skills I think, because of my background with my psychology degree and being a business owner/manager with a team to look after, I feel confident and passionate about working well in a team.<br>
          My limitation is not a limitation, really, it’s only my novice status with learning javascript and understanding computers. I’m only going to grow from here so I am looking forward to becoming more confident with programming skills.
          
          <h2>What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</h2>
          My biggest challenge will be to juggle my kids and organise a quiet space to work with my team, undisturbed. I also don’t want to let my team down if my skills are lesser than others, which is why I am going to practice!
          What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
          I would like to see myself grow in confidence when speaking in a group. I am confident if it is about a topic I am well versed in but if I am a novice, I take a backseat. I would like to challenge myself to be a bit more outspoken.
          <h2>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</h2>
          I expect dev academy to be understanding that I have four children and that that is a lot of children… haha no, sorry, I’ll be more specific.<br>
          I chose dev academy because I want to study part time, alongside raising my four children - I didn’t join dev academy to be a part time parent and a full time student so I expect an understanding from facilitators for me to find a balance that works for me as the stay at home parent for our family. And if I have that boundary respected, I will flourish.
          <h2>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</h2>
          My expectations for me during bootcamp is to clearly communicate if I cannot make a meeting and work my absolute hardest to support my team by keeping up with the learning material. I am determined to become a fullstack developer so I want to show up with 100% commitment and clear understanding of the material.

          <h2>Foundations<br>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h2>
          My long term goal is to have a stable and fun job in web development and software engineering that I can occasionally work remotely if needed. To begin with, my focus was finding employment that would be more flexible but I really do enjoy making something beautiful out of code! (or trying to)
          
          <h2>A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</h2>
          
          My strengths are my determination and love of seeing the end result. I also find learning coding skills fun so I look forward to the next lesson. My limitations are my time to learn, I am often trying to do it when my baby is napping or at night time - this too shall pass! Other limitations would be the overwhelm I can get (as mentioned before)
          
          <h2>What skills (non-technical/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h2>
          
          I’d like to see more confidence and outgoing behaviour in myself when it comes to job hunting and networking. I am an introverted - extrovert and I need an extra nudge to go out and get uncomfortable a lot of the time.
          <h2>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:
          <br>An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and industry/community representatives
          <br>What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you</h2>
          
          My motto is “a little bit, everyday”. Whether that is just reading or practicing code, it’s the commitment I have made to myself to learn a new skill and manage my workload. This method also helps to keep the overwhelm away!
          I will manage myself to work productively because I am driven. I am also aware that I have four children and it gets busy, so my commitment is to communicate adequately if I can’t make a meeting etc.
          
          <h2>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h2>
          
          My commitment is to seek help after I have given it time to ‘sleep on it’. I do not want to waste anyone's time with simple questions google could help me with but I also don’t want to get behind with a block!
          
          <h2>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h2>
          I expect a helpful hand and explanations when I do get blocked, in a kind manner. It’s also great to have facilitators who have a foot on the ground in the world of where we want to be.
          
          <h2>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.</h2>
          
          I have very clear block-out time from 8 - 9.30am and 2 - 3.30pm for school pick up/drop off. Also the bedtimes 6.30-8, but I am aware the bootcamp times are around this time so I am organising help with relatives during the key bootcamp dates.
