      <h2>Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people.
      </h2>
      <br>
      Neuroplasticity suggests that our brain development and IQ is not just fixed. We are not only born to have a certain ‘smart’ like they taught at school. People have a choice in their intelligence because it is a practice, and our age does not hinder our ability in this practice. More so, learning new things and practicing them form stronger neuron pathways leading to a healthier brain with age
      <br>
      <h2>Discuss how you might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for your benefit.
      </h2>
      <br>
      I think the idea of neuroplasticity contributes to the growth mindset idea. Due to the brain constantly forming new neural pathways and gaining stronger bonds with practice, it gives us this notion of not being stuck in a situation we don’t like when it comes to learning or jobs or experience. We can learn something new at any age and flourish with every choice we make. For me, at 36, this gives me a lot of motivation and hunger to be a better person and to always strive towards success.
      <br>
      <h2>What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?
      </h2>
      <br>
      Ways to increase neuroplasticity are:
      1- learning new skills
      2 - practising mindfulness
      3 - physical exercise is great for the brain
      4 - proper nutrition
      5 - get enough sleep

      This reading I found quite interesting:
      https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-brain-plasticity-2794886
      <h1>Research Growth Mindset
      </h1>
      <h2>Discuss what it is and why it is relevant.
      </h2>
      <br>
      Growth mindset is the belief that our ability and intelligence are not just fixed, we have the ability to work towards better intelligence and abilities. It is relevant because, as stated above, it provides people with an option instead of being stuck in situations that are not ideal, we can improve ourselves and make our lives better.
      <br>
      <br>
      <h2>In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?
      </h2>
      <br>
      It surprised me how we can link the notion of growth mindset to positivity. We need to believe we CAN or we just stay the same and don’t improve.
      <br>
      <h2>How will you integrate a growth mindset into your learning journey?
      </h2>
      I feel a hunger to be here and learn a new skill so I am happy to have a growth mindset already in this learning environment. I will try to improve my neuroplasticity, though, with the steps discussed above. 
      I think it is also really important to surround yourself with those who also have a growth mindset, it sure makes life easier being surrounded by people who believe in your ability to succeed!

      Also, this quote: “Confidence is just displayed ability.” 
      This quote from the habits of successful people reading, was a quote that really struck a chord. Growing up, I was always shy, introverted and told I was lacking confidence. I married a man who is full of confidence and is a musician who has played guitar and sung to thousands of people and I am always in awe of how naturally it comes to him. I think it is a mix of natural outgoing personality and practised ability.
      <h1>Blend with your learning plan and strategies
      </h1>
      <h2>Reflect and discuss how these understandings may shape or influence your learning plan and strategy.
      </h2>
      <br>
      I think the understanding of neuroplasticity and growth mindset shape my learning plan already, I just never really gave them a name until now! 
      Being 36, the neuroplasticity information hits home a lot more. It’s not just about growth mindset, it's about brain health and longevity.
