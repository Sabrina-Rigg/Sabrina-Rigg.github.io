      <h2>Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made, and how you reflect on the decision now.</h2>
      <br>
      Ahhh. This one is confronting. My ethical choices have been highlighted more than ever in the last 5 years due to owning a cafe during the time covid hit.
      Our ethical choices were slandered and smeared in ways that I am still recovering from. My ethical standpoint has always been to show kindness and understanding for every situation. I pride myself on being one of those people who can put on other’s shoes and see their point of view - within reason. I wholeheartedly believe that most people can find common ground, but first they need to practice removing their anger and ego. Ethically, I have always gravitated towards being a peacemaker.
      <br>
      <h2>Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your values and identity.</h2>
      <br>
      My culture by bloodline is German/Kiwi. I am the first generation of kiwi in our family, my parents both immigrated in the 80’s due to the cold war and met here.
      Identity wise, I am influenced by people and cultures who put spirituality and connection to earth and nature at the forefront of their being as that is what is most important to me.
      Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your learning journey.
      I’d say my strengths are my determination and visualisation for the end game. Sometimes it can take me a while to get the motivation but when it kicks in and I back myself, I’m in it for the long game. I think this will really help me through to the finish line with this course and learning new programming languages in the future.

      <h2>Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career development. How might these affect your learning journey?</h2>
      <br>
      My limitation is my sense of overwhelm. I can very easily get thrown into the deep end because my mind likes to skip ahead. I’m constantly battling with myself to take it slow and try not to get overwhelmed, otherwise I feel blocked and unable to learn. But I have strategies in place to overcome it and carry on.
      <br>
      <h2>Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why.</h2>
      <br>
      I’m going to bring up my time as a cafe owner during covid again. Our main strategies to customers who showed anger or frustration was to match it with kindness, calmness and understanding. In my 36 years of life, I’ve learnt that fear often comes out as aggression and it can usually take an act of kindness to throw them off balance and snap out of their ego.
      Another instance is having staff and enforcing rules and regulations around how the cafe is run smoothly. This can be tough! Especially when conflict is not in your nature, but I think if it is approached calmly and with a chance to compromise, a little conflict can be healthy.
      What would I do differently? Probably not try so hard to please every single person!
      One only has so much energy to spare and it is impossible to make everyone happy.
