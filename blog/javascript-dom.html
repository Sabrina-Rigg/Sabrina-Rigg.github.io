        <p>
          When you visit a website or use a web application, three key
          technologies are working behind the scenes: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
          Each one plays a different role, but they work together to create the
          websites and apps we use.
        </p>
        <h3>HTML – The Structure</h3>
        <p>
          HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the foundation of any web page.
          Think of it like the frame of a house — it provides the structure.
          HTML is used to create elements like headings, paragraphs, buttons,
          links, and images. For example, when you see a title or a button on a
          website, that’s HTML in action.<br />
          <br />
          Here’s a simple example of HTML code:<br />
          &lt;p&gt;Welcome to My Website&lt;/h1&gt;<br />
          &lt;p&gt;This is an example of a paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;
          <br />
        </p>
        <h3>CSS – The Style</h3>
        <p>
          CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is what makes a website look good. It
          controls the design — things like colors, fonts, layouts, and spacing.
          If HTML is the frame of the house, CSS is the paint, furniture, and
          decorations. With CSS, you can make a website look modern, colorful,
          and easy to navigate.<br />
          <br />
          Example of CSS:<br />
          h1 {<br />
          color: blue;<br />
          font-size: 24px;<br />
          }
        </p>
        <h3>JavaScript – The Behavior</h3>
        <p>
          JavaScript adds interactivity and functionality to a website. It makes
          things happen — like when you click a button and a pop-up appears, or
          when content changes without needing to reload the page. If HTML is
          the frame and CSS is the paint, JavaScript is the electricity that
          makes everything work.<br />
          <br />
          Example of JavaScript:<br />
          document.querySelector('button').onclick = function() {<br />
          alert('Button clicked!');<br />
          };
          <br />
        </p>

        <h3>How They Work Together</h3>
        <p>
          HTML creates the structure, CSS makes it look good, and JavaScript
          makes it interactive. For example, a "Buy Now" button is created with
          HTML, styled with CSS to make it look appealing, and JavaScript makes
          it work when you click it. Together, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript create
          the seamless web experiences we use every day!
          <br />
          An analogy I would use would be similar to the one used above: the
          house.<br />
          <br />
          HTML = the structure of the house e.g. the frame <br />
          <br />
          CSS = the style, colour and decorative features of the house <br />
          <br />
          Javascript = the function the utilities of the house e.g. tap turns
          the water on and off, light switches turn light on and off.
        </p>
        <h3>
          Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday
        </h3>
        <p>
          Control flow is the order in which you program an object. For an
          everyday example, we could say it is like following a method for
          making a cup of tea:<br />
          <br />
          1 = boil water<br />
          2 = if you have tea bags<br />
          - Place tea bag in a mug<br />
          3 = if you do not have tea bags<br />
          - Buy tea bags<br />
          - Place tea bag in a mug<br />
          3 = pour boiling water in the mug, leaving space for milk<br />
          4 = add a splash of milk<br />
          5 = drink tea<br />
          <br />
          A loop is when we repeat a task until certain conditions are met.<br />
          <br />
          For example:<br />
          Tea is too hot:<br />
          - Blow on tea<br />
          - Check temperature<br />
          - Stop loop until tea is at 60 degrees celsius<br />
        </p>
        <h3>
          Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with
          it.
        </h3>
        <p>
          Imagine that the computer screen is a lego house. The DOM (Document
          Object Model) is like the lego instructions that tell you about the
          lego bricks in the house. The HTML is the frame of the house, the
          foundations, door frames etc The CSS is the colour, layout and design.
          The DOM is what the computer uses when it looks at the instructions of
          a web page and understands how it is built. We can manipulate the DOM
          by using javascript which dives into the instructions and pinpoints
          the exact locations of the ‘bricks’ we want to change in the house.<br />
          <br />
          An example of javascript changing a button on a website would be:<br />
          document.getElementById(‘myButton’).innerText = “Hello”<br />
          <br />
          The above syntax finds the button called ‘myButton’ and changes the
          text within it to say “Hello”
        </p>
        <h3>
          Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.
        </h3>
        <p>
          ITo put it plainly, an array is like a list of something and an object
          is like a dictionary for something. An array declares a variable with
          a list of a certain property. The list always starts an index number
          starting with 0 as the first item in the list.<br />
          <br />
          An array example:<br />
          Fruit:<br />
          [0] apple<br />
          [1] banana<br />
          [2] pear<br />
          <br />
          Or in Javascript:<br />
          let fruit = [‘apple’, ‘banana’, ‘pear’]<br />
          console.log(fruit[1]) // output is banana<br />
          <br />
          An object declares a variable that has different properties that you
          access as keys. It acts as a dictionary for the variable that you are
          declaring.<br />
          <br />
          An object example:<br />

          let person = {<br />
          name: “Sabrina”,<br />
          age: 36,<br />
          job: “mum”<br />
          }<br />
          console.log(person.name) // output is Sabrina
        </p>
        <h3>Explain what functions are and why they are helpful.</h3>
        <p>
          To put it simply, a function is like a recipe card, it has a set of
          instructions that make a certain objective happen and you can ‘call’
          the function time and time again to see the objective.<br />
          <br />
          A simple example of a function is:<br />
          Function sum() {<br />
          return a + b;<br />
          }<br />
          <br />
          The function is called sum, the inputs (ingredients) are called a and
          b, the the instructions are to add a and b together.<br />
          <br />
          To use the function it looks like this:<br />
          let result = sum(5, 3);<br />
          console.log(result) // output is 8<br />
