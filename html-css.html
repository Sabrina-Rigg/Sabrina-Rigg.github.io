          What is the difference between Margin, Border and Padding?

        <p>
          The 3 layers of space around an element can be confusing! I have
          roamed the depths of the internet to help me (and you) understand and
          explain, in simple terms, what the difference between these 3 spaces
          are and this is what I have come up with:
        </p>
        <h3>Margin</h3>
        <p>
          A margin is the space outside of an element creating the distance in
          between elements.
          <br />
          For example, if two boxes have a margin: 20px; they will stay 20px
          apart from each other.
        </p>
        <h3>Border</h3>
        <p>
          This is probably the most simple one. A border is the edge of an
          element and it surrounds the padding and content. <br />It is often
          shown as an outline (border: 2px solid black;) in css on an image or
          other content.
        </p>
        <h3>Padding</h3>
        <p>
          This refers to the space INSIDE the element. Padding is placed between
          the content and the border. <br />If you increase the padding, the
          content gets pushed inwards.
          <br />
