          <h2>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h2>
          <br>
          My long term goal is to have a stable and fun job in web development and software engineering that I can occasionally work remotely if needed. To begin with, my focus was finding employment that would be more flexible but I really do enjoy making something beautiful out of code! (or trying to)
          <br>
          <h2>A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</h2>
          <br>
          My strengths are my determination and love of seeing the end result. I also find learning coding skills fun so I look forward to the next lesson. My limitations are my time to learn, I am often trying to do it when my baby is napping or at night time - this too shall pass! Other limitations would be the overwhelm I can get (as mentioned before)
          <br>
          <h2>What skills (non-technical/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h2>
          <br>
          I’d like to see more confidence and outgoing behaviour in myself when it comes to job hunting and networking. I am an introverted - extrovert and I need an extra nudge to go out and get uncomfortable a lot of the time.
          <h2>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:
          <br>An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and industry/community representatives
          <br>What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you</h2>
          <br>
          My motto is “a little bit, everyday”. Whether that is just reading or practicing code, it’s the commitment I have made to myself to learn a new skill and manage my workload. This method also helps to keep the overwhelm away!
          I will manage myself to work productively because I am driven. I am also aware that I have four children and it gets busy, so my commitment is to communicate adequately if I can’t make a meeting etc.
          <br>
          <h2>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h2>
          <br>
          My commitment is to seek help after I have given it time to ‘sleep on it’. I do not want to waste anyone's time with simple questions google could help me with but I also don’t want to get behind with a block!
          <br>
          <h2>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h2>
          I expect a helpful hand and explanations when I do get blocked, in a kind manner. It’s also great to have facilitators who have a foot on the ground in the world of where we want to be.
          <br>
          <h2>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.</h2>
          <br>
          I have very clear block-out time from 8 - 9.30am and 2 - 3.30pm for school pick up/drop off. Also the bedtimes 6.30-8, but I am aware the bootcamp times are around this time so I am organising help with relatives during the key bootcamp dates.
