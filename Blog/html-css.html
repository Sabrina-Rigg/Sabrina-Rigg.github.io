        <h2>What is the difference between Margin, Border and Padding?</h2>
        <p>
          The 3 layers of space around an element can be confusing!
          I have roamed the depths of the internet to find various artifacts to help me (and you)understand and explain in simple terms what the difference between these 3 spaces are and this is what I have come up with:
          </p>
          <h3>Margin (ally crazy)</h3>
          <p>A margin is the space outside of an element creating the distance in between elements.
            For example, if two boxes have a margin:20px; they will stay 20px apart from each other.
          </p>
          <h3>Border (land)</h3>
          <p>This is probably the most simple one. A border is the edge of an element and it surrounds the padding and content.
            It is often shown as an outline of border: 2px solid black; on an image or other content.
          </p>
          <h3>Padding (ington bear)</h3>
          <p>This refers to the space INSIDE the element. Padding is placed between the content and the border.
            If you increase the padding, the content gets pushed inwards.
  
            Visual representaion (chat GPT):
  
            |--- Margin ---|
                |--- Border ---|
                    |--- Padding ---|
                         Content
                    |--- Padding ---|
                |--- Border ---|
            |--- Margin ---|
  
            Hope this helps!</p>
